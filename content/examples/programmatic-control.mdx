# Programmatic control

Open and close the menu from code, and change its content, theme, or animation at runtime.

## What you'll see

Right-click or long-press the demo area to open the menu with “Option A” and “Option B”. The same menu could be opened from your own code with `menu.open(x, y)` or `menu.openAtElement(button, { placement: "bottom-start" })`. You can call `menu.close()`, `menu.setMenu(...)`, `menu.setTheme(...)`, or `menu.setAnimation(...)` to control state without user interaction.

## Key points

- **open(x, y)** — Show the menu at coordinates. Returns a Promise that resolves with the selected item (or undefined if closed without selection).
- **openAtElement(el, options)** — Show the menu next to an element; options include `placement` and `offset`.
- **close()** — Close the menu; returns a Promise that resolves when the close animation finishes.
- **setMenu / updateMenu** — Replace or update the menu items at runtime.
- **setTheme / setAnimation** — Change theme or animation without recreating the menu.
