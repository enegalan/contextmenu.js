# Nested menus

Menus can have multiple levels: submenus open to the side (or flip to the other side when space is limited).

## What you'll see

Right-click or long-press the demo area. The menu has a “New” action, an “Open” submenu (with “File…” and a “Recent” submenu containing files), a separator, and “Save”. Hover “Open” then “Recent” to open nested submenus, or use Arrow Right and Enter to open them with the keyboard.

## Key points

- **Nested submenus** — A submenu’s `children` can include another `type: "submenu"` for arbitrary depth.
- **children** — Can be an array (as here), a function that returns an array, or an async function for lazy-loaded items.
- **Positioning** — Submenus open to the right by default (or left in RTL); use [Configuration — Submenu placement](/docs/configuration#submenu-placement) to control.
