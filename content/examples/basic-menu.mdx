# Basic menu

A simple context menu with actions, a separator, and a submenu.

## What you'll see

Right-click or long-press the demo area below. A menu opens with two top-level items (Copy, Paste), a separator, and a “More” item that opens a submenu with Rename and Delete. Click an item to run its action (they only log in this demo).

## Key points

- **bind** — The menu is attached to the demo area with `menu.bind(element)`, so it opens on right-click or long-press.
- **Actions** — Each clickable row is an action item with `label` and `onClick`. Shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) are shown when provided.
- **Separator** — `{ type: "separator" }` adds a horizontal divider between groups.
- **Submenu** — `{ type: "submenu", label: "More", children: [...] }` opens a nested list on hover or Arrow Right.
