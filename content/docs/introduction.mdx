# Introduction

**contextmenu.js** is a smooth, customizable context menu library for the web. Use it to show right-click or long-press menus that feel native and are fully accessible.

## What it does

- Renders a menu at the pointer (or next to an element) with items, separators, and nested submenus.
- Supports actions, links, checkboxes, radio groups, and custom renderers.
- Handles positioning at viewport edges (flip/shift), animations, and theming via CSS or config.
- Works with keyboard navigation and screen readers (ARIA, roving tabindex, shortcuts).

## Features

- **TypeScript-first** — Full typings for menu items and API.
- **Framework-agnostic** — Use with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS.
- **Accessible** — ARIA roles, keyboard (arrows, Enter, Escape), focus management, and shortcut display.
- **Customizable** — Override styles with CSS variables, theme config, or custom item renderers.

## How it works (high level)

Flow: **User** (right-click or long-press) → **bind or open** → **Position** (menu) → **Render** → **Action** (select or close).

1. You create a menu with `createContextMenu({ menu: [...] })`.
2. You either **bind** it to an element (so it opens on right-click/long-press) or call **open** (with coords, event, or element + options) from your own event handlers.
3. The library positions the menu (with optional flip/shift to stay in view), renders it (often in a portal), and handles selection and close.
4. When the user picks an item or dismisses the menu, your callbacks run and the menu closes.

  Install the package, import the default CSS, call createContextMenu with a menu array, then call menu.bind(element). Right-click the element to open the menu.
