# Animations

Control enter and leave animations via the **animation** config passed to `createContextMenu`. You can also override timing with CSS variables.

## Animation options

<ApiTable
  headers={["Option", "Type", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["type", "\"fade\" or \"slide\"", "fade (default): opacity and scale. slide: opacity and translate."],
    ["enter", "number or object", "Duration in ms, or object with duration and easing."],
    ["leave", "number or object", "Same as enter for the leave animation."],
    ["disabled", "boolean", "If true, no enter/leave animation."],
  ]}
/>

**Types:**

- **fade** — The menu fades in and out and scales slightly (opacity and scale).
- **slide** — The menu fades in and out and moves (opacity and translate).

## Config example

```js
createContextMenu({
  menu: [...],
  animation: {
    type: "slide",
    enter: 150,
    leave: 100,
  },
});
```

With explicit easing:

```js
createContextMenu({
  menu: [...],
  animation: {
    enter: { duration: 150, easing: "ease-out" },
    leave: { duration: 80, easing: "ease-in" },
  },
});
```

## Disable animations

```js
createContextMenu({
  menu: [...],
  animation: { disabled: true },
});
```

## CSS variables for timing

You can override animation timing in CSS. The library sets these on the menu root; override them to change timing without changing config.

<ApiTable
  headers={["Variable", "Description", "Default"]}
  rows={[
    ["--cm-enter-duration", "Enter animation duration", "120ms"],
    ["--cm-leave-duration", "Leave animation duration", "80ms"],
    ["--cm-enter-easing", "Enter animation easing", "ease-out"],
    ["--cm-leave-easing", "Leave animation easing", "ease-in"],
  ]}
/>

Example:

```css
.cm-menu {
  --cm-enter-duration: 150ms;
  --cm-leave-duration: 100ms;
  --cm-enter-easing: ease-out;
  --cm-leave-easing: ease-in;
}
```

You can change animation at runtime with `menu.setAnimation(animation)`. See [API reference](/docs/api-reference).
